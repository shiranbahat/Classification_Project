Dementia Prediction using classification models


Data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers

The file contains Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults, a collection of 150 right handed subjects aged 60 to 96, both men and women.  

The file also consist data regarding years of education, socioeconomic status and mini mental state examination.

We tried to predict the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale

by exploring the relations between the variables:

and the MRI attributes:

### we used decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting models and also handled the unbalanced data to predict the CDR with 0.88 accuracy score
